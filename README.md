# OpenSAFELY Job Server

This Django app provides a simple REST API which provides a channel
for communicating between low-security environments (which can request
that jobs be run) and high-security environments (where jobs are run).


## Deployment
It is currently configured to be deployed Heroku-style, and requires
the environment variables defined in `dotenv-sample`.

The DataLab job server is deployed to our `dokku` instance.

## Testing
The contents of `dotenv-sample` should be edited and copied to `.env`.
A Django development server can be started with `docker-compose up`.


### V2
To test the integration of job-runner and job-server follow these steps:

#### Initial Run
1. Run job-server locally
1. Log in
1. Go to http://localhost:8000/workspaces/new and create a workspace
1. Create a workspace
1. Create a `JobRequest` via the actions list on the Workspace page
1. Configure job-runner to point at your local job-server
1. Run job-runner with `rm -f workdir/db.sqlite && python -m jobrunner.sync`

#### Subsequent Runs
1. Run this against the job-server database: `update jobserver_job set status_code = NULL, status_message = '', started = false, started_at = NULL, completed_at = NULL;` (this will wipe all local Job state)
1. Run job-runner with `rm -f workdir/db.sqlite && python -m jobrunner.sync`


## Add/Updating Static Assets
We don't currently use any kind of static asset management tool (eg npm, yarn,
etc) for this project.

Each static asset has been downloaded from the appropriate site and added to
the project with their version number.

To add or update an asset:

1. Download the asset from its respective site (with `wget` or your favourite tool)
1. Move the production version to `static/<location>/`
1. Rename to include the version number (eg `bootstrap.min.css` -> `bootstrap-4.5.0.min.css`)
