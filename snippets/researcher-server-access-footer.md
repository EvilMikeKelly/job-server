For each researcher who is not named on the "List of Accredited Researchers" document, which is found [at the bottom of this page][1], please email evidence of them completing safe researcher training to <applications@opensafely.org>.

If you do not have such training, you must register with the ONS' [Research Accreditation Service (RAS)][2].
ONS courses are visible once your RAS application is completed.
If you decide to attend a [UK Data Service course][3], you should specify in your email to them that you are "Applying for AR status through the ONS Research Accreditation Service" (you still need to complete a RAS application).
