If you require access to any of the below datasets, the host organisations providing the data may also need to approve access to them; there will also be associated [acknowledgement and data sharing / publication policies](https://www.opensafely.org/policies-for-researchers/#acknowledgment-and-data-sharing--publication-policy) that must be adhered to. 

OpenSAFELY will contact the applicant to discuss any additional approval processes.
