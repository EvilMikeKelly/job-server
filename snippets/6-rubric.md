If you need assistance to determine if your work is research, service evaluation, audit, or a short data report, or help understanding the HRA process, in the first instance you should seek help from your [local NHS R&D Office](https://rdforum.nhs.uk/rd-contacts-directory/).

Other helpful resources:

* the [HRA definitions of research, service evaluation and audit](http://www.hra-decisiontools.org.uk/research/docs/DefiningResearchTable_Oct2017-1.pdf)
* the [HRA “is it research” decision tool](http://www.hra-decisiontools.org.uk/research/)
* if  you are still unsure, email the HRA directly on <queries@hra.nhs.uk> (please contact OpenSAFELY to discuss further if necessary)

For reference, the [OpenSAFELY favourable Health Research Authority (HRA) opinion](https://www.hra.nhs.uk/planning-and-improving-research/application-summaries/research-summaries/open-corona-research-platform-phase-i-covid-19/).

## Short data reports

OpenSAFELY supports short data reports (sometimes also referred to as Data Curation Projects),
which provide a carefully documented source of information on data quality that is beneficial to all users of NHS data.
These cover four key areas:

1. Clinical reports describing how a specific clinical area is recorded in NHS data.
1. Demographic reports describing population characteristics and how they can be identified.
1. Administrative reports describing patterns in NHS data.
1. Methodological reports describing data processing techniques for NHS data.
