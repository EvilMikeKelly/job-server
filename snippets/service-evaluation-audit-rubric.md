We will need the following information:

1. Universities and hospital trusts, and other national organisations (e.g. NICE, ONS, etc.), and many healthcare related organisations and charities, will typically have access to a local institutional ethics committee. Please provide evidence that the committee has assessed your project as being a service evaluation, audit or health surveillance.
2. If you do not have access to a local institutional ethics committee, you can obtain supportive evidence from your [NHS R&D office](https://rdforum.nhs.uk/rd-contacts-directory/), or by using the [HRA “is it research” decision tool](http://www.hra-decisiontools.org.uk/research/) (please save the outcome of the tool and send it to us); or if you are still unsure, please [contact the HRA for advice](https://www.hra.nhs.uk/about-us/contact-us/)).
3. When using the HRA decision tool, please note the information supplied on their [Defining Research](https://www.hra-decisiontools.org.uk/research/docs/DefiningResearchTable_Oct2022.pdf) table on page 3: “for the purpose of this policy framework, research is defined as the attempt to derive generalisable or transferable new knowledge to answer or refine relevant questions with scientifically sound methods. **This excludes audits of practice and service evaluations**".
4. Evidence of support from a senior sponsor, usually an NHSE individual, such as a national clinical lead, band 9, director, or the sponsor might be a member of SAGE, JCVI, etc.
