There are two levels of access to OpenSAFELY available for researchers:

* **access to the OpenSAFELY results server (also referred to as the Level 4 environment)**
    * where you review your study results before applying disclosure controls and requesting their release
* **access to OpenSAFELY's GitHub organisation**
    * where you store your study code, which is then executed against the patient data held on the results server; where you view results that have been released from the results server (after disclosure controls have been applied)

We ask that you think very carefully about how many researchers apply for access to the OpenSAFELY results server. As a security measure, this should typically be the main study author only.

Only those results necessary for discussion, or for inclusion in the final report/paper, should be [requested for release](https://docs.opensafely.org/releasing-files/) from the results server.

Once they have been checked as "safe" by the OpenSAFELY output-checkers, they are released to your specific OpenSAFELY GitHub repository. You should keep the repository private until your project is complete and [NHS England approval is obtained](https://www.opensafely.org/policies-for-researchers/#acknowledgment-and-data-sharing--publication-policy).

As well as being where "safe" results are released, the OpenSAFELY GitHub repository is also where all your study code is written. Additional team members can have access to the OpenSAFELY GitHub repository:

* to help write the study code
* to review released results as part of discussions to inform manuscripts/reports/presentations.

Prior to wider sharing or publication of results, reports or papers, you must consult the following: [Permitted Study Results Policy](https://www.opensafely.org/policies-for-researchers/#permitted-study-results-policy), [Authorship Policy](https://www.opensafely.org/policies-for-researchers/#authorship-policy), [Acknowledgement and Sharing/Publication Policy](https://www.opensafely.org/policies-for-researchers/#acknowledgment-and-data-sharing--publication-policy) and the [Information Governance and Ethics content Policy](https://www.opensafely.org/policies-for-researchers/#information-governance-and-ethics-content-policy).

All reseachers named in the following section will by default be provided with access to the OpenSAFELY GitHub organisation. 
Of them, you will be asked to identify key researchers who require additional access to the OpenSAFELY results server.
