There are two levels of access to OpenSAFELY available for researchers:

* _access to the OpenSAFELY results server_ — for review of OpenSAFELY study results before release
* _access to OpenSAFELY's GitHub organisation_ — for submission of studies to OpenSAFELY

*We ask that you think very carefully about how many researchers apply for access to the OpenSAFELY results server. As a security measure, this should typically be the main study author only.*

Only those results necessary for discussion, or for inclusion in the final report/paper, should be [requested for release](https://docs.opensafely.org/releasing-files/) from the results server.

Once they have been checked as "safe" by the OpenSAFELY output-checkers, they are released to your specific OpenSAFELY GitHub repository. *You should keep the repository private until your project is complete and NHS England approval is obtained.*

As well as being where "safe" results are released, the OpenSAFELY GitHub repository is also where all your study code is written. Additional team members can have access to the OpenSAFELY GitHub repository:
* to help write the study code
* to review released results as part of discussions to inform reports/papers.

Furthermore, these "safe" results can also be shared in confidence with wider members of the research team, including external collaborators. For example, the study author may copy the outputs from the GitHub repository to a document being prepared for publication, or to seek feedback and contribution from other colleagues to inform the final paper or report.

However, prior to any open publication (e.g. [MedRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/)), the final paper/report, including a brief lay summary of the important conclusions,  must first be emailed to amir.mehrkar@phc.ox.ac.uk who will seek final approval for release from NHS England. The purpose of this approval step is to check that the paper/report aligns with the stated application purpose.
