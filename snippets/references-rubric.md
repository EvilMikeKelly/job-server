You must apply for HRA approval and obtain a favourable opinion from HRA's NHS research ethics committee (REC).

The rationale for this (which applies to most OpenSAFELY research analyses):

* [HRA approval for the project is needed](https://www.myresearchproject.org.uk/help/hlphraapproval.aspx#Which-projects-apply-for-HRA-Approval) because your analysis is “a project based study” using NHS patient data. 
* NHS REC review is needed (as indicated by the [HRA ethics decision tool](http://www.hra-decisiontools.org.uk/ethics/)) because the research in OpenSAFELY involves processing confidential information of patients or service users outside of the care team without consent and/or the research has [Section 251 Support: regulation 3(4) of the Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002](https://www.england.nhs.uk/contact-us/privacy-notice/how-we-use-your-information/covid-19-response/coronavirus-covid-19-research-platform/).
