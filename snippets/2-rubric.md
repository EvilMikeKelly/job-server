Currently the data held in OpenSAFELY can only be analysed for COVID-19 related purposes; see the [OpenSAFELY purposes for processes](https://www.england.nhs.uk/contact-us/privacy-notice/how-we-use-your-information/covid-19-response/coronavirus-covid-19-research-platform/) and the list of [approved projects](https://www.opensafely.org/approved-projects/) for examples.

Studies must not release any information that identifies or could identify STPs, Local Authorities, CCGs and individual GP practices (either directly, e.g. name. or indirectly e.g. list size).
