By defining your project as a short data report, you are also confirming it is not a research project, a service evaluation or an audit, as defined by the [HRA toolkit][] and this [definition table][].

Short data reports (sometimes also referred to as Data Curation Projects) provide a carefully documented source of information on data quality that is beneficial to all users of NHS data.
These cover four key areas:

1. Clinical reports describing how a specific clinical area is recorded in NHS data.
1. Demographic reports describing population characteristics and how they can be identified.
1. Administrative reports describing patterns in NHS data.
1. Methodological reports describing data processing techniques for NHS data.

Your line manager (which could be a principal investigator you work with) must email <applications@opensafely.org> to confirm your project is a short data report (and not a research project, a service evaluation or an audit),
and that they have read the Study Information and Study Purpose, and our [OpenSAFELY principles][], and they support the application.

You must also provide evidence this is not a research project, a service evaluation or an audit, for example, by completing the [HRA toolkit][] or providing a note from your institutional ethics committee confirming the study is not a research project, a service evaluation or an audit.
