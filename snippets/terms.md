# Terms of use of OpenSAFELY
This section details the terms of use of OpenSAFELY. By agreeing to these terms, you can continue to submit your access request. Please review the terms carefully.

## Conditions of OpenSAFELY data use
* OpenSAFELY operates as a trusted research platform; no record level data is permitted to be extracted from the platform.
* All outputs from the OpenSAFELY-EMIS/-TPP NHS England COVID-19 research platform must be aggregated data with [small number suppression](https://securedatagroup.org/sdc-handbook/) applied.
* At this time, studies must not release any information (e.g. name, listsize) that identifies, or could identify, Sustainability and Transformation Partnerships (STPs), Local Authorities, Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) and individual GP practices.

## Publication of study results using OpenSAFELY data
NHS England oversees final approval for all publication ready papers or reports to check the outputs align with the stated application purpose. NHS England has been extremely supportive of all research and analyses to date. Particular note may be given to the content of service evaluations sponsored by NHS England. The usual response time for approval is 1 week.

Following approval, as part of the [principles you are signing up to](https://www.opensafely.org/principles/) we expect you to make:

* all study definition code
* codelists
* results released from the platform (with disclosure controls applied)

public at or before the time when results are shared; and papers are submitted for peer review publication.

In line with OpenSAFELY's [open science philosophy](https://docs.opensafely.org/open-methods/), we will automatically make the GitHub repository public (to include the study definition code, codelists and released results) 12 months after any code has been executed against the pseudonymised patient records.

## Your data in public OpenSAFELY dashboards
In addition, OpenSAFELY will create a public dashboard listing for all approved studies:

* description of purpose
* contact email of researcher
* affiliated organisation
* when first code run
* link to GitHub repository (to be made public at most 12 months after first code executed, and in almost all cases at the time of results dissemination)
* links to published material (supplied by researchers)

This public dashboard is supplementary to the live public audit log of all analyses.
