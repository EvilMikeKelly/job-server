## Conditions of OpenSAFELY data use
* OpenSAFELY operates as a trusted research platform; no record level data is permitted to be extracted from the platform.
* The data held in the OpenSAFELY-EMIS/-TPP NHS England COVID-19 research platform can only be analysed for [COVID-19 related purposes](https://www.england.nhs.uk/contact-us/privacy-notice/how-we-use-your-information/covid-19-response/coronavirus-covid-19-research-platform/).
* You can view a list of [approved projects](https://www.opensafely.org/approved-projects/) to help you decide if your application is appropriate.
* All outputs must be aggregated data with [small number suppression](https://securedatagroup.org/sdc-handbook/) applied.
* At this time, studies must not release any information (e.g. name, listsize) that identifies, or could identify, Sustainability and Transformation Partnerships (STPs), Local Authorities, Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) and individual GP practices (see [permitted study results policy](https://www.opensafely.org/policies-for-researchers/#permitted-study-results-policy)).

## OpenSAFELY Policies

It is important you familiarise yourself with the following policies:

* [Permitted Study Results Policy](https://www.opensafely.org/policies-for-researchers/#permitted-study-results-policy)
* [Authorship Policy](https://www.opensafely.org/policies-for-researchers/#authorship-policy)
* [Acknowledgement and Sharing/Publication Policy](https://www.opensafely.org/policies-for-researchers/#acknowledgment-and-data-sharing--publication-policy)
* [Information Governance and Ethics content Policy](https://www.opensafely.org/policies-for-researchers/#information-governance-and-ethics-content-policy)

NHS England ([the Data Controller for OpenSAFELY](https://www.england.nhs.uk/contact-us/privacy-notice/how-we-use-your-information/covid-19-response/coronavirus-covid-19-research-platform/)) oversees the final approval for all publication ready manuscripts, reports or presentations, principally to check that the outputs align with the stated application purpose; NHS England has been extremely supportive of all research and analyses to date.

The usual response time for approval is 1-2 weeks. There are other datasets we hold ([such as ICNARC, ISARIC, ONS-CIS](https://www.opensafely.org/policies-for-researchers/#for-the-datasets-listed-below)), which require additional approvals from their source institutions.

Following approval, as part of the [principles you are signing up to](https://www.opensafely.org/principles/), at or before the time when your results are published (as  manuscripts, reports and presentations), we expect you to make your project's GitHub repository public in order to share:

* all study definition code
* all codelists
* all results released from the platform (with disclosure controls applied)

**NOTE:** In line with OpenSAFELY's [open science philosophy](https://www.opensafely.org/about/#contributing-to-best-practice-around-open-science), we will automatically make your GitHub repository public (to include the project's study definition code, codelists and released results) 12 months after any code has been executed against the pseudonymised patient records.

## Your data in public OpenSAFELY dashboards
In addition, OpenSAFELY will create a public dashboard listing for all [approved projects](https://www.opensafely.org/approved-projects/), including:

* description of project purpose
* contact email of project lead(s)
* affiliated organisation
* when code is first run against the patient data
* link to GitHub repository (to be made public at most 12 months after first code executed, and in almost all cases at the time of results dissemination)
* links to published material (supplied by researchers)

This public dashboard is supplementary to the [live public audit log of all analyses](https://jobs.opensafely.org/).

## How the OpenSAFELY team supports you
We have written [detailed documentation](https://docs.opensafely.org/) about the platform including a [getting started guide](https://docs.opensafely.org/getting-started/).

We have a [Q&A forum](https://github.com/opensafely/documentation/discussions).

We also offer researchers a [co-pilot](https://www.thedatalab.org/blog/191/opensafely-co-pilot-programme-assisting-users-on-their-opensafely-journey/): a member of the OpenSAFELY team who joins you on your OpenSAFELY journey, to help you achieve a completed analysis within an agreed timeframe (usually 4 weeks).
