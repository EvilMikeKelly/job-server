## What data can I access via OpenSAFELY?

Our [documentation](https://docs.opensafely.org/) lists the available [data sources](https://docs.opensafely.org/en/latest/dataset-intro/).

The OpenSAFELY reports site details the [database schema](https://reports.opensafely.org/reports/opensafely-tpp-database-schema/) for datasets and the [last import date](https://reports.opensafely.org/reports/opensafely-tpp-database-builds/) for that data.

## Before you begin

You will need:

- a free GitHub account ([sign up](https://github.com/signup) if you don't have one already)
- information about your proposed research to briefly describe the aims, potential methods and the expected outputs
- contact details for the individuals who will write the study code and/or review the results (individuals can have different levels of platform access, described later)
- to have completed the OpenSAFELY [Getting Started guide](https://docs.opensafely.org/getting-started/)

Importantly, if your study is **research**, you will need a favourable opinion from an NHS Research Ethics Committee, obtained via the HRA IRAS process. [Note: the HRA and HCRW Approval step is NOT required, therefore, on your IRAS form, for question 3a choose the option "This study does not involve the NHS‚Äù.]

If your study is a **service evaluation/audit**, you will need to evidence this (explained later), obtain a favouable opinion from a local / institutional Research Ethics Committee and provide evidence of support from a senior sponsor, such as an NHSE national clinical lead, band 9, director, or the sponsor might be a member of SAGE, JCVI, etc.

NOTE: For NHSE/I applicants review by a local / institutional Research Ethics Committee will not be required; for the existing approved Bennett Institute/LSHTM Observatory/Aftershocks workstream, sponsorship is also not required, but may be requested on a case-by-case basis by the OpenSAFELY team.
