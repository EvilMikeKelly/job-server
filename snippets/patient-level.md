By applying to use OpenSAFELY you are declaring that you need patient level access, (even though you wonâ€™t directly see those patient level cohort tables in the OpenSAFELY TRE model). 

You will need patient level data access if your question requires the creation of cohorts (cases/controls) of individuals and for each specific individual you need to know the presence or absence of covariates / characteristics. Although the running of statistical models on these cohorts creates aggregate data, if you need the underlying patient level cohorts, then your study does need patient level data
